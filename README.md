This is a class project for Web Programming @ CSU San Marcos.
Goal of the program is to scrape a variety of job boards and
aggregate them together for easy access.

3. Install BeautifulSoup  > pip install beautifulsoup4
4. Install Flask > pip install flask
5. Install MySQL v5.7.2 (If wanting to test locally) > https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

# Technologies Used
- Python - The foundation for job scraping and data aggregation
- MySQL - The backend for the project
- Flask - Servers as a framework for our web page routing
- Beautiful Soup - For parsing through the html responses
- Pandas - Using a data frame as a model for all of the data


# Things That Need To Be Done
- Implement Flask framework with web pages
- Implement MySql DB w/ project
- Create user registration aspect w/ DB implementation (signup/signin)
- Implement settings page w/ DB (setting changes should reflect DB table)
- Run script in dashboard and pull listings
